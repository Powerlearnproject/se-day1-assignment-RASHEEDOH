# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering- is the creation, testimg and implementation of digital solutions to solve real world problems
it is important because:
1.It allows us to come up with real time innovations to problems
2.It assists in automation of mundane daily tasks 
3.It helps organizations achieve goals and manage important tasks 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Requirements specification
it involves gathering all possible information regarding a software before development can begin
Testing and debugging
it involves identifying and correcting of all possible bugs and issues once a software solution has been developed
Deployment
It involves release of software solution to the market and It is usually the final step in the software development cycle

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a unique software that allows for development and testing of realtime software solutions.Examples of such IDEs include Eclipse and Intellij


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering- It is the utilization of unique words or texts to get the best possible resutls from an AI model
1.it is important as it allows for more accurate results out of utilization of an AI model
2.In software development it allows for faster output of results which are more clean
3.Allows for faster testing and debugging as the underlying issues of the code or application can easily be resolved


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example
Draw me Alice in Wonderland

Improved prompt
Assume you were Alice about to fight the Jabberwocky and the dragon's seemed hungry.Draw for me Alice in Wonderland in her shiny armour bravely facing the Jabberwocky 

In the new prompt, I gave the AI model more context to work with hence more accurate and pleasing result.Therefore the AI model understands the look and emotion to potray when It provides me with results
